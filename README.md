# discord-SMART-monitoring-hook

Gather SMART :bulb: details from all disks and post a message in ***Discord***!

## Goals
* Learning
  * Do you need all of this tech just to post a message in Discord? No.
    * The goal is to learn more about both `Docker` and `.NET Core` while solving a fun problem :smiley: :100:
* **Almost** zero confiuration
  * Throw all of this functionality into a Docker image, read a few environment secrets, and *go*!
